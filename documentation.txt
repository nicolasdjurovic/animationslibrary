Saenimate Animations Library
By Nicolas Djurovic

- Link saenimate.css to .html file. 
- Animations only work if .saenimate class is added to an HTML element.
- If you're using the animations with color, you need to apply a background-color (in your own css) to an element for the animation to work.
